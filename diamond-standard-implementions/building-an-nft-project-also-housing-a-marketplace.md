  In this project we would be building a classic NFT project which would not
  just hold the NFT logic but also a logic for purchasing these NFTs handling

# Building an NFT project also Housing a Marketplace

Implementing this example using the diamond standard would expose us to many extraordinary kinds of stuff using the diamond standard can help you achieve. I am a Typescript lover so this implementation would be using a Typescript template for Diamond 3 to get started. Please follow me closely everything will be just fine.

#### What are we building

So basically we are buidling an NFT contract what has all the basic functionality of an NFT contract and also housing a Marketplace where this NFT would be minted to other user when the pay an ERC20 token.
