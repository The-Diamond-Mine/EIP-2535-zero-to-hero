# Talking about the imports

#### IERC721Receiver

The IERC721Receiver interface imported would be used to make sure that a contract trying to receive the NFT must knowingly implement the functionality stating that it is expecting to receive an ERC721 token. On this note, in the interfaces folder, we would be creating a file in the interfaces folder called IERC721Receiver.sol and enter this code.

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.6.0) (token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol)

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title ERC721 token receiver interface
 * @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support safeTransfers
 * from ERC721 asset contracts.
 */
interface IERC721Receiver {
    /**
     * @dev Whenever an {IERC721} `tokenId` token is transferred to this contract via {IERC721-safeTransferFrom}
     * by `operator` from `from`, this function is called.
     *
     * It must return its Solidity selector to confirm the token transfer.
     * If any other value is returned or the interface is not implemented by the recipient, the transfer will be reverted.
     *
     * The selector can be obtained in Solidity with `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector`.
     */
    function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

#### IERC721Metadata

This interface defines functions that would return the metadata of the NFT and this interface also inherits the IERC721 interface which defines all the functions that must be implemented by the NFT base contract. So we would be creating a file named IERC721Metadata.sol and paste this code.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// OpenZeppelin Contracts v4.4.1 (token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol)

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IERC721.sol";

/**
 * @title ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional metadata extension
 * @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
 */
interface IERC721Metadata is IERC721 {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the token collection name.
     */
    function name() external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the token collection symbol.
     */
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for `tokenId` token.
     */
    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

The interface IERC721Metadata, inhereits the IERC721 that discribes all the functions needed to be implemented by an ERC721 contract. So as usual create a file in the interfaces folder name IERC721.sol and paste the code below.

```solidity

     */
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `owner` enables `approved` to manage the `tokenId` token.
     */
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId);

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manage all of its assets.
     */
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the number of tokens in ``owner``'s account.
     */
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

Next up is the import list is the Address.sol. This is an openzepplin library that provide utils functions when dealing with addresses, transferring ether, and lots more.



Create a file called Address.sol in the libraries folder and enter in this snippet of code.
